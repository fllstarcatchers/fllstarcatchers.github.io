    Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common disorder that occurs when the median 
    nerve, which runs from your forearm into the palm of the hand,
     becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. 
    This hand brace we are creating, prevents the wrist from moving an excessive 
    amount, and keeps it steady. If you do not take the proper support and care 
    for your wrist while playing the violin or 
    viola, you could easily develop improper habits that could lead to carpal 
    tunnel syndrome, which can hurt you in the long run.  Inexperienced 
    individuals who do not have the proper guidance whilst playing, 
    could damage susceptible to these risks.

    The effects of carpal tunnel syndrome are that the hand feels numbness, weakness, 
    pain in your hand and wrist, and your fingers may become swollen and useless.

    To prevent carpal tunnel syndrome 
        whilst playing, avoid frequent hand movements, 
        and wear a hand brace.
