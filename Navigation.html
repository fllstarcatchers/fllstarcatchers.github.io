    Introducing team <b>Star Catchers</b>!
    We present to you a game-changing solution through 
    our innovation project: a hand brace/stabilizer designed specifically
    for viola and violin players. Our invention guarantees
    that these young artists can follow their interest 
    in music without worrying about the possibility of developing
    Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Our product offers the crucial support
    and stability many need when beginning their musical journey.
    By eliminating the improper movement in your left wrist and hand,
    our device will prevent the formation of early bad habits. Our goal
    in producing this website is to raise awareness of the significance
    of good posture.
